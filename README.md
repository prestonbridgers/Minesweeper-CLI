# Minesweeper-CLI

This is a project that I took on because I thought the recursive discovery of "empty" cells around the chosen cell was an interesting problem to try and solve.

Ideally this sort of thing wouldn't be implemented in Java, but it was the language I was most comfortable with at the time.

# Controls

- w-Enter -> Move cursor up one cell
- a-Enter -> Move cursor left one cell
- s-Enter -> Move cursor down one cell
- d-Enter -> Move cursor right one cell

- x-Enter -> "Dig" the currently selected cell
- f-Enter -> Flag the current cell
